Can be used with cloud
Supports multi platform development, extensive cloud integration, and advanced controls for complex builds
Can view and manage builds using web UI or utilize kotlin DSL for managing build configurations as code
Two primary components:
TeamCity server provies UI for managing build configurations and reviewing results
the TeamCity build agent executes build configurations and build jobs and can beinstalled on premise or on the cloud
Works on windows linux and mac
works with docker, aws, github
Free version allows for up to 100 build configurations, and 3 build agents
Paid version allows unlimited build configurations, pricing is based on # of build agents
A build agent performs the tasks of a build pipeline (checks source code, runs tests, compiles code) 
On Linux, Java SE JRE installation required? Java 8 support will be discontinued in one of the future TeamCity releases. If you use a non-bundled version of Java 8, we highly recommend that you migrate your server to Java 11 or 17.
